# Cohort Analysis for Assessing Customer Retention in E-commerce Industry

This project performs a cohort analysis on an e-commerce dataset to assess customer retention and purchasing behavior over time. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Project Overview

Cohort analysis is a powerful technique that groups customers based on shared characteristics (such as their first purchase month) and tracks their behavior over time. This helps businesses understand customer retention, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve customer loyalty.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and ensures correct data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes sales and customer distribution by country and month.
- **Cohort Analysis:** Groups customers by their first purchase month and tracks retention.
- **Retention Rate Calculation:** Calculates and visualizes the percentage of returning customers for each cohort over time.
- **Quantity Analysis:** Analyzes average quantity bought by each cohort.
- **Visualizations:** Uses seaborn and matplotlib for clear, insightful plots.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
